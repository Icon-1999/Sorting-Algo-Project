# Sorting-Algo-Project

Project starts with an array of random numbers(lines)

You can pick between Insertion sort and Selection sort to sort each line in order

Press "space" to start the sort

Press "n" to change to a new unsorted array of lines

Press "c" to change between sorts

Will add more sorts in the future!
